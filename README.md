# Amfoss-Tasks

## INTRODUCTION

I am Ganesh S. A first-year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate (S1, 2025–2029 batch) at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri campus. I have beginner-level coding skills and my favorite programming language is Python. My interests are playing badminton, discovering technology, and constant self-enhancement. I believe in dedicating effort and delivering my best with each task I undertake.

## Why should we select you?

I strongly believe in commitment, discipline, and consistency. During the Praveshan tasks, I’ve made sure to stay active, post updates, and push myself to learn new concepts. I’m eager to adapt to new challenges and expand my knowledge in areas I’m not yet familiar with. My curiosity and dedication motivate me to go beyond my comfort zone. I am sure that my commitment and eagerness to learn will make me an asset to the AM@FOSS community.

## How do you intend to contribute back to the club?

I will participate actively in club discussions, activities, and events. I will not be a quitter halfway through; rather, I am willing to invest the time and effort necessary to give back substantial contributions. I feel that all the hard work is eventually rewarded, and I want to translate that into my contribution. I will also participate in projects and competitions to represent AM@FOSS and help promote the club's values and work. My aim is to develop along with the community while contributing back through code, ideas, and dedication.

## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?

My main area of interest is computer science. I love programming with Python, and I desire to learn more about sectors such as web development, open-source contribution, and new technologies such as blockchain. I'm also very interested to know how blockchain can be applied to real-life applications and FOSS projects. Although I am presently just starting out, I'm willing to learn step by step.
Personally, I also intend to work on self-discipline and personal growth outside of academics, balancing physical and mental development along with technical ability.

## What are your thoughts and feedback on the Praveshan Selection Process?

The Praveshan activities have been an enjoyable yet challenging experience. Every activity challenged me to learn something new, and I've learned something invaluable that I wouldn't have discovered otherwise through independent exploration. At first, the assignments appeared daunting, but over time I managed to take them up with determination and inquisitiveness. Thanks to the seniors and mentors for framing such an organized process. Even if I am not selected, I will absorb the learnings and keep improving myself. Although I did not finish all the tasks, I tried my best at everything that I did, and the experience itself was very satisfying.
