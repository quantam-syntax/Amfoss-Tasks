# Amfoss-Tasks

INTRODUCTION

Myself, Ganesh S. I am a first-year Computer Science and Engineering undergrad (S1, 2025–2029 batch) at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri campus. I know beginner-level coding and my preferred language is Python. My hobbies include playing badminton, exploring technology, and continuous self-improvement. I am committed to putting in the hard work and giving my best in every task I take on.

Why should we choose you?

I strongly believe in commitment, discipline, and consistency. During the Praveshan tasks, I’ve made sure to stay active, post updates, and push myself to learn new concepts. I’m eager to adapt to new challenges and expand my knowledge in areas I’m not yet familiar with. My curiosity and dedication motivate me to go beyond my comfort zone. I’m confident that my determination and willingness to learn will make me a valuable addition to the AM@FOSS community.

How do you intend to contribute back to the club?

I will actively engage in discussions, tasks, and events organized by the club. I will not be someone who gives up midway; instead, I am ready to dedicate the time and effort needed to contribute meaningfully. I believe every bit of hard work pays off in the long run, and I want to reflect that in my contributions. Additionally, I will take part in competitions and projects to represent AM@FOSS, helping to showcase the club’s work and values. My goal is to grow along with the community while giving back through code, ideas, and commitment.

What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?

My primary field of interest lies in computer science. I enjoy working with Python, and I want to expand my knowledge into areas like web development, open-source contributions, and emerging technologies like blockchain. I’m particularly curious about how blockchain can be integrated into real-world applications and FOSS projects. Though I am still at the beginning of my journey, I’m eager to learn step by step.
On a personal note, I also want to focus on self-discipline and improvement outside academics, balancing fitness and mental growth along with technical skills.

What are your thoughts and feedback on the Praveshan Selection Process?

The Praveshan tasks have been a challenging yet rewarding experience. Each task pushed me to learn something new, and I’ve gained valuable knowledge that I would not have otherwise explored on my own. Initially, the tasks seemed intimidating, but gradually I learned to tackle them with persistence and curiosity. I am grateful to the mentors and seniors for creating such a well-structured process. Even if I don’t get selected, I’ll take the lessons and continue improving myself. Though I wasn’t able to complete all the tasks, I gave my best effort in everything I worked on, and that journey itself was very fulfilling.
